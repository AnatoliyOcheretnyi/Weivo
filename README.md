# Weivo

Weivo is a weight-tracking app focused on expressive animations, high performance, and native-quality interactions. The goal is to explore gesture-driven experiences, Reanimated, and Skia while keeping the UI clean and data-dense.

## What this app is for

- Track weight over time with a visual-first experience.
- Prototype animation-heavy interactions without sacrificing performance.
- Serve as a playground for native modules, gestures, Reanimated, and Skia.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
